# Hypothesis-Testing-of-Movie-Ratings-Data
This project involves analyzing a movie ratings dataset to answer critical research questions using hypothesis testing.
The dataset consists of ratings from 1,097 research participants for 400 movies, alongside additional behavioral and demographic data. The analysis is framed as a corporate task for a major movie studio to optimize operations and understand viewer preferences.

# Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
  - Perform hypothesis testing to address specific research questions about movie ratings and viewer behavior.
  - Apply rigorous statistical techniques with a significance level of alpha = 0.005 to minimize false positives, as per Benjamin et al. (2018).

# Dataset Description
- Movies Rated: 400
- Participants: 1,097
  - Data Columns:
    - Columns 1–400: Movie ratings (scale: 0–4; may include missing data).
    - Columns 401–421: Sensation-seeking behaviors (scale: 1–5).
    - Columns 422–464: Personality questions (scale: 1–5).
    - Columns 465–474: Self-reported movie experience ratings (scale: 1–5).
    - Column 475: Gender identity (1 = female, 2 = male, 3 = self-described).
    - Column 476: Only child status (1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = no response).
    - Column 477: Social viewing preference (1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = no response).

  - Reference : Wallisch, P., & Whritner, J. (2017). Our taste in movies is highly idiosyncratic and at odds with critics.

# Questions addressed 
The following questions are explored as part of the analysis:
  - Popularity and Ratings: Are popular movies rated higher than less popular ones?
  - Age and Ratings: Are newer movies rated differently than older ones?
  - Gender and Ratings: Is there a gender-based difference in the enjoyment of Shrek (2001)?
  - Gender Proportions: What proportion of movies are rated differently by male and female viewers?
  - Only Child Effect: Do only children enjoy The Lion King (1994) more than those with siblings?
  - Sibling-Based Proportions: What proportion of movies exhibit sibling-related rating differences?
  - Social Watching: Do social watchers enjoy The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) more than solitary viewers?
  - Social Watching Proportions: What proportion of movies show a social watching effect?
  - Distribution Comparison: Are the ratings distributions of Home Alone (1990) and Finding Nemo (2003) different?
  - Franchise Consistency: How many movies from selected franchises are of inconsistent quality?
